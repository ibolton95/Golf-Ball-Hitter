# Planning

## Problem
Mini-golf is always fun, and during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is a great alternative to multi-person sports. We want to create a golf ball hitter and obstacles to create a fun game that can be easily played alone at the push of a button.

## Resources
Our resources include Onshape, a MetroExpress board, a servo, wires, and a breadboard.

## Constraints
The servo may not be strong enough to sufficiently hit the ball, but we will test this after our design has been made. We may have trouble printing our pieces at the Sigma Lab due to Covid-19 restraints and us not being there.

## Solutions
Our CAD designed arm must be light so the servo can swing it and hit the ball. We hope to finish our pieces on the early side to give Dr. Shields ample time to print them.

## Original Design Concept
We are not exactly sure what our setter should look like to optimizie its hitting ability at this point, but once we create an initial design in OnShape we will update this design section with new images.

## Updated Design
We are now going to make a golf ball putter since the servo will not be able to set a spikeball. The idea stays generally the same as do the contrainsts. We are still worried about the weight, but we believe that the sideways motion and wider paddle-shaped end will aid the servo in hitting the ball. Also, a small golf ball will definitely be easier for the servo to push than a larger spikeball.

This is our new design.
