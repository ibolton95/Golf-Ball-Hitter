# Planning

## Problem
Playing Spikeball during the Covid-19 pandemic has been hard since it requires you to be in close proximity to other people. Our solution to this problem is to create a Spikeball setter.

## Resources
Our resources include Onshape, MetroExpress, a servo, wires, and a breadboard.

## Constraints
The servo may not be strong enough to sufficiently hit the ball. We may have trouble printing our pieces at the Sigma Lab due to Covid-19 restraints and us not being there.

## Solutions
Our CAD designed arm must be light so the servo can lift it. We hope to finish our pieces on the early side to give Dr. Shields ample time to print them.
